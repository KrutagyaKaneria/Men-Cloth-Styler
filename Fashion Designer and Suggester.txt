Fashion Designer and Suggester

1. User Profile: This is where the magic starts. Users create a profile with their personal information, including gender, style preferences (e.g., casual, bohemian, formal), size details, and color palettes they like or dislike.

2. Virtual Wardrobe: This feature is the core of the platform.

Item Upload: Users can upload images of their clothes. The site should use computer vision and machine learning to automatically categorize the item (e.g., t-shirt, jeans, dress), detect its color, and identify its style.

Item Management: Users should be able to organize their items by type, season, occasion, and even create tags for specific events or moods.

3. Outfit Suggestions: This is the main functionality that provides value.

Outfit Builder: A drag-and-drop interface for users to manually create outfits from their virtual wardrobe.

AI-Powered Recommendations: The system suggests complete outfits based on the user's wardrobe, style preferences, and external factors like local weather and upcoming events from their calendar.

4. Discovery and Shopping: This is how the site goes beyond just organizing a closet.

"Complete the Look": For a user's chosen outfit, the system can recommend complementary items that they don't already own, like a specific type of shoe or a bag.

Price Comparison: For recommended new items, the platform will display a list of online retailers where the item is available, along with their current prices, to help the user find the best deal.
