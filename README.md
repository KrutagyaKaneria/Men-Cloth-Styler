Problem Statement

Getting dressed should be exciting, not exhausting! Yet for many people—regardless of gender, size, or style—choosing an outfit can feel like a daily struggle. From figuring out what works for your body type and skin tone, to matching colors, planning for occasions, and keeping up with trends, the process can quickly turn stressful. We end up wearing the same few outfits, leaving half our wardrobe untouched, or buying clothes that don’t quite fit our style.

Our Solution

We’re building an AI-powered fashion assistant and virtual wardrobe manager that turns “What should I wear?” into a fun, effortless experience. Here’s how:

👕 Digitize Your Wardrobe – Snap or upload photos of your clothes, and our AI tags them by type, color, fabric, and season.
✨ Personalized Outfit Suggestions – Get looks that suit your body type, skin tone, budget, and the occasion—using clothes you already own.
🎯 Smart Wardrobe Optimization – Discover hidden combinations, identify missing essentials, and make every piece work harder for you.
🌦 Always On-Trend – Recommendations adapt to your local weather, seasonal styles, and personal preferences.
🛍 Shop Smarter – Fill wardrobe gaps with budget-friendly, trend-conscious suggestions—plus price-drop alerts for items you love.
🌍 Inclusive for Everyone – Designed for all genders, sizes, and cultural styles, so great style is never out of reach.

Our mission: Help you look and feel your best, every single day—without the stress, waste, or guesswork.
